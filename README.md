In this project, I delved into the intricacies of deep learning using Keras, a powerful library for building neural networks. Here's a glimpse of what I explored:

Data Preparation: I started by preparing two datasets â€“ one for regular season games and another for tournament games, each containing valuable information like team IDs, score differentials, and outcomes.

Keras Refresher: I refreshed my understanding of Keras by revisiting essential concepts like input layers, dense layers, and model compilation.

Two Input Networks: Explored creating models with two input layers, focusing on predicting tournament outcomes by considering factors like seed differences and score differentials.

Category Embeddings: Managed high-cardinality categorical variables using embedding layers, ensuring efficient representation while handling diverse team data.

Shared Layers: Implemented shared layers to streamline model architectures, optimizing resources and enhancing performance for multi-input scenarios.

Merge Layers: Leveraged merge layers for combining multiple inputs, exploring operations like addition and concatenation to enrich model capabilities.

Stacking Models: Explored the powerful technique of stacking models to improve predictions, emphasizing diversity, ensemble methods, and cross-validation.

Multiple Outputs: Dived into models with multiple outputs, catering to scenarios where predicting multiple target variables is essential for comprehensive insights.

Single Model for Classification and Regression: Demonstrated the versatility of a single model to handle both regression and classification tasks, showcasing its adaptability across diverse use cases.

Advice on Stacking in Deep Learning: Shared key insights and tips for effective stacking in deep learning, emphasizing model diversity, ensemble methods, and interpretability.
